<!--
- The logical content of this DIV - which we're using to logically categorize a part of our page - is that it has
  html elements that allow product search input.
- Keep in mind that although we set our class attribute value to provide logical content categories, we also use it
  outside of this scope solely to do things like bootstrap does - we specify a class value based on the device size 
  to leverage bootstrap's CSS.  This is not using class to specify logical content.
