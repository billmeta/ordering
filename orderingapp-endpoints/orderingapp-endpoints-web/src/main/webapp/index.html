- It's a good idea to specify the class for each html element - this is NOT specifying the
  style!  It's saying what the HTML element LOGICALLY is and then, in a separate css file, we use a CSS selector
  to apply a style based on the class (or id, etc.)
- Specifying the class does NOT cause the browser to go looking for a style w/ a CSS selector matching
  that class - it ONLY provides a class name for the html element.  Its original intent was to logically specify
  what the content is.  The idea is to not have any styling info in our HTML page.  Instead, we logically
  define our HTML page in terms of the content, using DIV elements to define logical parts of our
  HTML page (or some of the newer HTML5 elements for logically specifying parts of our page) and specifying the
  class attribute for different HTML elements based, again, on its logical content.
- We then use CSS rule sets to set one or more EXISTING HTML Element Style properties on HTML elements by
  specifying a CSS selector that selects one or more elements based on the class attribute (or other attribute).
  These style properties in a CSS rule set are NOT 'CSS styles' - they are style properties that are defined for
  the HTML elements!  In other words, we could just simply avoid using CSS rule sets and just specify the style properties
  on each specific HTML element in the HTML file (e.g. style.color=red).  This is not good practice, though.  We instead want to set the style
  properties for the HTML elements based on the logical content (e.g. the class name we gave an HTML element specifies what
  that HTML element logically contains or ... the DIV element specifies a logical category of content for the HTML page).
- Note, however, that changing the style attributes of an HTML element gives us more than just what we'd normally think
  of as styling (the way the element looks, its color, etc.).  Many of the attributes give us special effects - e.g.
  being able to show/hide a DIV element (and all of the other HTML elements inside it) by setting the HTML style attribute,
  'visibility', to 'hidden' or 'visible'.  Or we can change position style attributes to make it look like the html element is moving.


- Best practice with angularJS is to have the views as html and not as JSP - we're rendering on the
  client-side by angularJS processing its directives that are in the view (especially with the bidirectional
  model / html element binding).  
- Angular views should use angular directives instead of jQuery or javascript.  Angular model objects
  are used with angular directives.  We also favor angular model objects over regular jQuery and
  javascript objects, variables.   Reason: angular directives and model objects are used to render
  the view.  We get automatic re-rendering of the view any time a model object changes value.

- Note that we're NOT using a <form> element - we CAN use it which is a convenience for getting the
  data from the html elements in the <form>...</form> block and sending it to the server in an http request
- Not using a <form> element doesn't have anything to do w/ angularJS.  It's just that when we decide not
  to use it and to manually do our own submission of the values in the html elements, we use angularJS directives
  instead of straight javascript.

- Our shell page (this page) for angularJS has the ng-app directive - same name as the module defined in app.js 
-->
<body id="ng-app" ng-app="ordering-app">

<!-- 
Standard pattern for angular:
- Add an HREF w/ # for each view - the # changes the location of the browser to go to area on same page
	without going to the server - that's the key - we want the location to change so that angular knows
to process it and see if a route matches to load a view but without the browser sending an http request.

Note: normally, we'd provide a corresponding <a href name="view1"> for where the browser should go to
on the page but we leave it out because we don't want that -- and browser doesn't complain.

- I arbitrarily put the 3rd-party js files in a folder, lib, that I created under the web app's root.  It's completely
  arbitrary.  No web server gives that folder any special meaning.
- Don't confuse 'lib' with WEB_INF/lib.  WEB-INF and WEB-INF/lib are part of the J2EE servlet specification for when
  we're using servlet engines like tomcat.  Servlet engines will add WEB-INF/lib and WEB-INF/classes to the java
  CLASSPATH.  We put our java jars in WEB-INF/lib and our java class files (ones that aren't in a jar) in WEB-INF/classes.
  
- Good idea to keep the debugger's console open - resolve all errors before continuing.  'console' tab shows errors.
  'network' tab shows which js and css files are missing.
- Note: Based on http header settings, the file won't be downloaded if not modified on the server (and debugger will 
  show an http 304 response)
- There's a difference with debuggers - e.g. I found that google chrome's debugger showed underscore-min.map 
  missing whereas firefox's debugger did not.  

- Note: easiest to use bower (package manager) to get the needed 3rd party js and css files
- Use the non-minimized version of the js files for development and the minimized for production (note: there
  are tools to allow debugging even with minimized js and css code but ...)
- Include all the javascript code (angularJS, etc.) and need to be in correct order (if a file needs code
  that's in another file, the other file needs to be included before it)
- Put scripts inside the body - browser will still render the web page while it retrieves each of the
  js files (you can see them being separately retrieved in the browser debugger - network tab)
